\begin{abstract}
% This is a manuscript template for Data Descriptor submissions to \emph{Scientific Data} (\href{http://www.nature.com/scientificdata}{http://www.nature.com/scientificdata}). The abstract must be no longer than 170 words, and should succinctly describe the study, the assay(s) performed, the resulting data, and the reuse potential, but should not make any claims regarding new scientific findings. No references are allowed in this section.

% Following Scientific Data format - 170 words max, no references
% Pattern from Pernet2019, Niso2018, Holdgraf2019
The Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) has facilitated data sharing and tool development in human neuroimaging.
We present an extension for microelectrode electrophysiology recordings in animal models, addressing the unique requirements of intracellular and extracellular recordings.
This extension introduces two new data types: 'icephys' for intracellular and 'ecephys' for extracellular recordings, supporting diverse recording modalities from patch-clamp to high-density silicon probes.
Building on existing BIDS principles and prior electrophysiology extensions, we specify metadata for probes, electrodes, and channels, with particular attention to metadata required for spike sorting analysis.
The extension adopts NWB (Neurodata Without Borders) and NIX (Neuroscience Information Exchange) as data formats, ensuring comprehensive metadata capture while maintaining compatibility with existing analysis ecosystems.
We provide example datasets covering common use cases and demonstrate integration with established tools including [Which tools?].
This standardization enables reproducible analysis pipelines, facilitates data sharing through repositories like DANDI, G-Node and EBRAINS, and bridges scales from cellular to systems neuroscience.

\section*{Background \& Summary}

% (700 words maximum) An overview of the study design, the assay(s) performed, and the created data, including any background information needed to put this study in the context of previous work and the literature. The section should also briefly outline the broader goals that motivated the creation of this dataset and the potential reuse value. We also encourage authors to include a figure that provides a schematic overview of the study and assay(s) design. The Background \& Summary should not include subheadings. This section and the other main body sections of the manuscript should include citations to the literature as needed.

% 700 words max, following structure from Gorgolewski2016, Pernet2019, Holdgraf2019

% Paragraph 1: Field context and technological advances
% Following Pernet2019 opening
Microelectrode electrophysiology encompasses techniques for recording electrical activity from individual neurons to local field potentials, providing crucial insights into neural computation.
Recent technological advances, including high-density silicon probes and standardized probe designs through the Neuropixels project, have dramatically increased data acquisition rates and experimental complexity.
% Add statistics on data growth, number of labs using these techniques

% Paragraph 2: Current standardization landscape and fragmentation
% Following pattern from Holdgraf2019, Niso2018
While comprehensive data formats exist for neurophysiology (NWB; NIX),
the field lacks standardized organization principles for datasets, metadata specifications, and directory structures.
This fragmentation impedes data sharing, with surveys indicating [ADD SURVEY DATA] of researchers struggling to share or reuse electrophysiology data due to inconsistent formats and missing metadata.
% Reference Neo, existing tools showing fragmentation

% Paragraph 3: BIDS success and extension rationale
% Following Gorgolewski2016, Poldrack2024
BIDS has successfully standardized human neuroimaging data organization [cite],
with over 850 datasets on OpenNeuro [cite] and adoption by major repositories.
Prior BIDS extensions for human electrophysiology (EEG [cite], MEG [cite], iEEG [cite])
established patterns for organizing time-series neural data, while the Microscopy extension [cite]
introduced critical metadata fields for animal data.

% Paragraph 4: Unique challenges for microelectrophysiology
% New content specific to BEP032
Microelectrode recordings present unique challenges:
(1) electrode scales spanning orders of magnitude (sub-micron tips to millimeter arrays),
(2) diverse probe geometries requiring specialized coordinate systems,
(3) spike sorting as an essential preprocessing step requires specific metadata,

% Paragraph 5: Extension overview and contributions
Here we present BEP032, extending BIDS to microelectrode electrophysiology, with a focus on animal models.
This extension: [summarize key contributions]
% List main contributions following Holdgraf2019 pattern

% Include Figure 1: Schematic overview (following Pernet2019 Fig 1, Bourget2022 Fig 1)
% Show directory structure, data flow, and relationship to other modalities

\section*{Methods}

% The Methods should include detailed text describing any steps or procedures used in producing the data, including full descriptions of the experimental design, data acquisition assays, and any computational processing (e.g. normalization, image feature extraction). See the detailed section in our submission guidelines for advice on writing a transparent and reproducible methods section. Related methods should be grouped under corresponding subheadings where possible, and methods should be described in enough detail to allow other researchers to interpret and repeat, if required, the full study. Specific data outputs should be explicitly referenced via data citation (see Data Records and Citing Data, below).

% Authors should cite previous descriptions of the methods under use, but ideally the method descriptions should be complete enough for others to understand and reproduce the methods and processing steps without referring to associated publications. There is no limit to the length of the Methods section. Subheadings should not be numbered.

\subsubsection*{Design Decisions}
% Following MEG-BIDS choice to not require format conversion
% Justify NIX/NWB requirement vs allowing native formats
% Discuss division between icephys and ecephys

The division between intracellular (icephys) and extracellular (ecephys) electrophysiology is based on the recording techniques and the resulting data characteristics. Icephys typically involves high-resolution recordings from individual neurons, requiring detailed metadata about the cell type, location, and experimental conditions. In contrast, ecephys captures broader population activity, necessitating metadata that describes the electrode array configuration, spatial sampling, and signal processing methods.

\section*{Data Records}

% The Data Records section should be used to explain each data record associated with this work, including the repository where this information is stored, and to provide an overview of the data files and their formats. Each external data record should be cited numerically in the text of this section, for example \cite{Hao:gidmaps:2014}, and included in the main reference list as described below. A data citation should also be placed in the subsection of the Methods containing the data-collection or analytical procedure(s) used to derive the corresponding record.
