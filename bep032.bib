The goal of Motion-BIDS is to make motion data interoperable across different laboratories and with other data modalities in human brain and behavioral research. To this end, Motion-BIDS standardizes the data format and metadata structure. It describes how to document experimental details, considering the diversity of hardware and software systems for motion data. This promotes findable, accessible, interoperable, and reusable data sharing and Open Science in human motion research.},

	abstract = {Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) is an increasingly popular neuroimaging technique that measures cortical hemodynamic activity in a non-invasive and portable fashion. Although the fNIRS community has been successful in disseminating open-source processing tools and a standard file format (SNIRF), reproducible research and sharing of fNIRS data amongst researchers has been hindered by a lack of standards and clarity over how study data should be organized and stored. This problem is not new in neuroimaging, and it became evident years ago with the proliferation of publicly available neuroimaging datasets. To solve this critical issue, the neuroimaging community created the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) that specifies standards for how datasets should be organized to facilitate sharing and reproducibility of science. Currently, BIDS supports dozens of neuroimaging modalities including MRI, EEG, MEG, PET, and many others. In this paper, we present the extension of BIDS for NIRS data alongside tools that may assist researchers in organizing existing and new data with the goal of promoting public disseminations of fNIRS datasets.},

	abstract = {Data standardization promotes a common framework through which researchers can utilize others’ data and is one of the leading methods neuroimaging researchers use to share and replicate findings. As of today, standardizing datasets requires technical expertise such as coding and knowledge of file formats. We present ezBIDS, a tool for converting neuroimaging data and associated metadata to the Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) standard. ezBIDS contains four major features: (1) No installation or programming requirements. (2) Handling of both imaging and task events data and metadata. (3) Semi-automated inference and guidance for adherence to BIDS. (4) Multiple data management options: download BIDS data to local system, or transfer to OpenNeuro.org or to brainlife.io. In sum, ezBIDS requires neither coding proficiency nor knowledge of BIDS, and is the first BIDS tool to offer guided standardization, support for task events conversion, and interoperability with OpenNeuro.org and brainlife.io.},

	abstract = {The Brain Imaging Data Structure (BIDS) established community consensus on the organization of data and metadata for several neuroimaging modalities. Traditionally, BIDS had a strong focus on functional magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) datasets and lacked guidance on how to store multimodal structural MRI datasets. Here, we present and describe the BIDS Extension Proposal 001 (BEP001), which adds a range of quantitative MRI (qMRI) applications to the BIDS. In general, the aim of qMRI is to characterize brain microstructure by quantifying the physical MR parameters of the tissue via computational, biophysical models. By proposing this new standard, we envision standardization of qMRI through multicenter dissemination of interoperable datasets. This way, BIDS can act as a catalyst of convergence between qMRI methods development and application-driven neuroimaging studies that can help develop quantitative biomarkers for neural tissue characterization. In conclusion, this BIDS extension offers a common ground for developers to exchange novel imaging data and tools, reducing the entrance barrier for qMRI in the field of neuroimaging.},
